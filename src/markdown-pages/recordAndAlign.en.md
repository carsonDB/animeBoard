This chapter will take you to introduce how to record and the automatic alignment function.

## Recording
It is best to need a microphone to record in a quiet environment.
Each paragraph is recorded separately, and the sequence does not matter, and it can be recorded repeatedly.

If it is an existing audio (supporting most formats), it can also be imported directly.

## Automatic alignment
Every time you record or import audio, the software will automatically align the audio with the text to form a verbatim script (the position of each word in the audio).
